Late at Night is a display typeface that my brother
[Gabriel Ratzlaff](http://ratzlaff.com.br) and I created together in 2018. We wanted to
bring our typography skills to a new level, and to find out if we could make some money out of
itâ€”which we did.

I believe creating a typeface is one of the biggest challenges a designer can face, and the
knowledge it brings changes the way we design everything else.
