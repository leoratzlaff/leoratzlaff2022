I designed and developed Pomo King to practice a few skills like graphic design, UI, UX, and web
development, and also have a Pomodoro app that would actually work for me.

## Key features

Three key features make Pomo King unique and useful:

- **No buttons**: Different from my original idea, it has no buttons. “But how do I control it?”—you may say. You don’t. It’s
  synced to your device clock.
- **Clock synced to the device**: Focus time always starts when the minutes from your device’s clock are at 0 or 30. You focus for 25
  and rest for 5. When time is up, the bell rings.
- **Custom sounds**: A slightly different sound rings when you finish focus time and resting time. Once you learn the difference, you don't have to look at the app anymore.

## Web development

For developing Pomo King, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was able to achieve the maximum score at the four main criteria of Google's Lighthouse—a tool for measuring the quality of web pages—and have as a next step to make it a perfect PWA.
